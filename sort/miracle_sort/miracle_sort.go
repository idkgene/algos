package miraclesort

/*
Miracle Sort is a humorous "sorting algorithm" that:
1. Checks if array is sorted
2. If not - waits for some time and checks again
3. Repeats until array magically becomes sorted

The idea is based on a programming joke that if you wait long enough,
quantum fluctuations might randomly sort your array.

Visual representation of the process:

    [4,2,1,3] -> check -> not sorted -> wait
    [4,2,1,3] -> check -> not sorted -> wait
    [4,2,1,3] -> check -> not sorted -> wait
    ... (infinite waiting for miracle) ...

This algorithm is considered one of the least efficient sorting algorithms
as it may never terminate.

Time Complexity: O(âˆž) - may never terminate
Space Complexity: O(1) - uses only a constant amount of extra space
